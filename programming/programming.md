# Programming notes

## Terms

### block

(1) A group of contiguous storage locations, computer program statements,
records, words, characters, or bits that are treated as a unit.

**See also:** block-structured language; delimiter.

(2) To form a group as in (1)

**Contrast with:** deblock

### condition

an expression that is evalued as true/false

### expression

the smallest unit of computation. Consist of some operands and some
operators. Evalued to produce a result

### function

(1) A defined objective or characteristic action of a system or component.
For example, a system may have inventory control as its primary function.

**See also:** functional requirement; functional specification;
functional testing.

(2) A software module that performs a specific action, is invoked by
the appearance of its name in an expression, may receive input values,
and returns a single value.

**See also:** subroutine.

### operation

(1) In computer mathematics, the action specified by an operator on one or
more operands. For example, in the expression A = B + 3, the process of
adding B to 3 to obtain A.

(2) In programming, a defined action that can be performed by a computer
system; for example, addition, comparison, branching.

**Note:** Unlike the mathematical meaning, such an operation may not involve
an operator or operands; for example, the operation Halt.

(3) The process of running a computer system in its intended environment
to perform its intended functions.

### operator

A mathematical or logical symbol that represents an action to be performed
in an operation. For example, in the expression A = B + 3, "+" is
the operator, representing addition.

### statement

In a programming language, a meaningful expression that defines data,
specifies program actions, or directs the assembler or compiler.

**See also:** assignment statement; control statement; declaration.
